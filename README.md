# HTAX Functional Verification (SV-UVM)

## Overview
This project was achieved by performing 10 lab assignments in a phasewise manner, with each lab progressively building on the previous ones. The final culmination of the entire effort was Lab 10, where all concepts and verification methodologies were integrated to thoroughly verify the HTAX design. The project utilizes SystemVerilog and UVM to model the HTAX environment, validate functionality, and ensure high coverage metrics while identifying and debugging potential issues.

## Goals
- Develop a UVM-based testbench environment for HTAX.
- Implement constrained random stimulus and SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs).
- Achieve high coverage (block, expression, toggle) and 100% functional coverage.
- Identify and debug design bugs using regression tests and waveform analysis.

## Tools Used
- **SystemVerilog**: For testbench design and assertions.
- **UVM**: To create and enhance the verification environment.
- **Cadence Xcelium**: For simulations.
- **Cadence V-Manager**: For managing coverage analysis.

## Features
- UVM components: driver, monitor, scoreboard, sequencer.
- Constrained random stimulus and functional coverage targets.
- Regression testing and waveform debugging for bug identification.
- Detailed coverage reports and verification results.
